Bias is a conscious or subconscious preference in favour of or against a person, group or thing.

Data bias is a type of error that systematically skews results in a certain direction and can affect the way we collect and interpret data. It can take several forms:
- **Sample bias**: when the sample chosen isnâ€™t representative of the whole (e.g. including only walkers in a survey on commuting habits)
- **Observer bias**: the tendency for different people to observe things differently (e.g. consistently rounding up or down a blood pressure reading, two doctors interpreting the same scan differently)
- **Interpretation bias**: the tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way
- **Confirmation bias**: the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms pre-existing beliefs
