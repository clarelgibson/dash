As a data analyst, you have to consider what [[Data|data]] is going to useful and relevant for your [[Data|analysis]]. However, you can't ignore data that doesn't appear to be relevant. You need to consider all available data so that your analysis reflects the truth and not just your own expectations.
### Example
A stateâ€™s Department of Transportation is interested in measuring traffic patterns on holidays. At first, they only include metrics related to traffic volumes and the fact that the days are holidays. But the data team realizes they failed to consider how weather on these holidays might also affect traffic volumes. Considering this additional data helps them gain more complete insights.
