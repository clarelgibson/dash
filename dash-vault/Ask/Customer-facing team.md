Skills: #communication #stakeholder-management

This group includes anyone within the organisation that has some level of interaction with customers and potential customers. They compile information, set expectations and deliver customer feedback to other parts of the internal organisation.

These stakeholders have their own objectives and may seek to tell a story that is not supported by the data. It is important that you as the analyst let the data tell the story and don't be swayed by the asks from these stakeholders to find certain patterns that may not exist.
