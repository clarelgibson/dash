Skills: #questioning

Is the question specific? Does it address the problem? Does it have context? Will it uncover a lot of the information you need?

### Examples
* Do you currently use data to drive decisions in your business? If so, what kind(s) of data do you collect, and how do you use it?
* What kind of data do you use to build your lessons?
* What data do you use to help with purchasing and inventory?
