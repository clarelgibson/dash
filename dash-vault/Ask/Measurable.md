Will the question give you answers that you can measure?
### Examples
* Do you know what percentage of sales is from your top-selling products?
* How well do student benchmark test scores correlate with their grades?
* Can you order (rank) these factors from most to least influential on sales: price, flavor, and time of year (season)?
