The Ask stage of the [[Google's Data Analysis Framework|data analysis framework]] consists of the following things:

* [[Define the problem]], business challenge or objective. The [[Five Whys technique]] can help here.
* Fully understand [[Stakeholders|stakeholder]] expectations. What are their business goals and what kind of results do they hope to achieve from the analysis?
* Decide which [[SMART questions|questions]] to answer in order to solve the problem.
* Define ways of working with your stakeholders through a [[Scope of work]], including how and when to communicate progress throughout the project, and the expected format for delivering the results.
* Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions.
* Take a step back and see the whole situation in context.
## Example
An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the [[Google's Data Analysis Framework|data analysis process]] to answer the following question: **How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?**

Collaborate with the key [[Stakeholders|stakeholders]] who will be interested in the outcome of the analysis to ask effective questions such as:

* What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job?
* Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we access the historical data?
* Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?
* What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
* By what percentage would you like to see retention improve in the next fiscal year?
