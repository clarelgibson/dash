Stakeholders hold a stake in the project. They are the people who have invested time, interest and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.

There can be many stakeholders in a project, such as your manager, executive sponsor or sales partners. What they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence [[Act|actions]] and strategies and have specific goals that they want to meet.

[[Scope of work|Ask the right questions]] of your stakeholders to help you fully explore the project.

Stakeholders broadly fall into three groups:
1. [[Executive team]]
2. [[Customer-facing team]]
3. [[Data science team]]
## Good stakeholder management
* Discuss goals. All conversations with stakeholders should include questions about their goals and motivations. What do they expect to achieve from this analysis?
* Know your project. Keep track of all of the discussions over email and meetings, and know how your project connects to the rest of the company.
* Start with words and visuals so everyone is on the same page when it comes to the scope and deliverables of the analysis project.
* Communicate often on milestones, setbacks and changes. Keeping your notes in a shareable report, like a [[Change-log|change-log]] is a good way to allow stakeholders view progress on demand.
