Bad data does not follow [[Good data|ROCCC principles]]:
- **Not reliable**: data that is inaccurate, incomplete or biased. Could be caused by sampling bias or graphs that are misleading (e.g. not starting axis from 0)
- **Not original**: when you cannot locate the original data source and are relying on second or third party information.
- **Not comprehensive**: missing important information needed to answer your question.
- **Not current**: out of data and therefore inaccurate.
- **Not cited**: donâ€™t use data that has not been cited or vetted.

Bad data can have serious consequences leading to bad business decisions or broken processes.
