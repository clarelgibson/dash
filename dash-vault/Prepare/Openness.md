Free access, usage and sharing of data. Some people believe that all data should be made available freely and globally. This means we should be able to make data open if the other principles of data privacy are met.

Many technical hurdles need to be overcome to make open data a reality, including data interoperability, which is the ability of data systems and services to openly connect and share data.

For data to be considered open, it has to:
- Be available and accessible to the public as a complete dataset
- Be provided under terms that allow it to be reused and redistributed
- Allow universal participation so that anyone can use, reuse, and redistribute the data

Data can only be considered open when it meets all three of these standards.
## Examples of open data
1. [**U.S. government data site**](https://www.data.gov/ "U.S. government data site"): Data.gov is one of the most comprehensive data sources in the US. This resource gives users the data and tools that they need to do research, and even helps them develop web and mobile applications and design data visualizations. 
2. [**U.S. Census Bureau**](https://www.census.gov/data.html "U.S. Census Bureau"): This open data source offers demographic information from federal, state, and local governments, and commercial entities in the U.S. too. 
3. [**Open Data Network**](https://www.opendatanetwork.com/ "Open Data Network"): This data source has a really powerful search engine and advanced filters. Here, you can find data on topics like finance, public safety, infrastructure, and housing and development.
4. [**Google Cloud Public Datasets**](https://cloud.google.com/datasets "Google Cloud Public Datasets"): There are a selection of public datasets available through the Google Cloud Public Dataset Program that you can find already loaded into BigQuery. 
5. [**Dataset Search**](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/ "Dataset Search")**:** The Dataset Search is a search engine designed specifically for data sets; you can use this to search for specific data sets.
## Benefits of open data
- Credible data can be used more widely and joined with other credible sources
- This can advance scientific research
