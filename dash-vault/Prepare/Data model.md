A model that is used for organising data elements and how they relate to one another. They keep data consistent and provide a map of how data is organised within a system. 

Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of how data is structured, organised and related. A data model is a bit like a blueprint. There will be lots of different people that need to understand the overall structure of the data model, even if they each have different data needs as individuals.

There are three common types of data modeling, which increase in complexity:
1. [[Conceptual data model]] focussed on business concepts
2. [[Logical data model]] includes data entities
3. [[Physical data model]] includes the physical tables
