Data generation, collection, storage and data management. In this phase you will identify data sources, gather [[Data|data]] and verify that it is accurate and useful to answer your [[Ask|questions]].

Use your [[Business tasks|business task]] to decide:
* What metrics to measure
* Locate data in your database
* Create security measures to protect that data
## Example
An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: **How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?**

The team built a timeline of three months and decided on ways of working to relay progress to interested parties. They also used this step to identify the data sources that would be needed to identify a successful result. In this case they chose to gather data from a survey of new employees.

* They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and overall compensation.
* They established rules for who would have access to the data. For example, they decided that only those people within the analysis group would have access to the raw data, and anyone outside the group could access aggregated data.
* They decided on what specific information would be gathered and how best to present the data visually. This included identifying possible project-related issues and how to avoid them.
