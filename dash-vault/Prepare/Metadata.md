Metadata is used in database management to help analysts interpret the contents of the data within the database.

There are three common types:
- **Descriptive**: describes a piece of data and can be used to identify it at a later point in time (e.g. a bookâ€™s ISBN, title and author)
- **Structural**: indicates how a piece of information is organised and whether it is part of one, or more than one, data collection (how pages of a book are put together into chapters)
- **Administrative**: indicates the technical source of a digital asset (type of file, date/time created)
## Benefits of metadata
- **Reliability**: metadata helps analysts to confirm if data is [[Good data|reliable]] by making sure it is accurate, precise, relevant and timely.
- **Consistency**: metadata helps analysts to check for uniformity across different datasets
