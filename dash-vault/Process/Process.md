## Example
An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: **How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?**

The group sent out the survey and made sure to adhere to data ethics practices. They ensured that employees provided their consent to participate in the survey and the ensured that participants were informed about how their data would be collected, stored, managed and protected.

* They restricted access to the raw data to a limited number of analysts.
* They cleaned the data to ensure it was complete and accurate.
* They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for another layer of security.
