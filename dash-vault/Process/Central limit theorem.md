As sample size increases, the results more closely resemble the normal (bell-shaped) distribution from a large number of samples. A sample of 30 is the smallest sample size for which the CLT is still valid. Researchers who rely on **regression analysis** – statistical methods to determine the relationships between controlled and dependent variables – also prefer a minimum sample of 30.
