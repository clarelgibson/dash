Using a [[Sampling|sample]] can lead to uncertainty about whether the results from the sample can be translated to the [[Population|population]]. The difference between the sampleâ€™s results and that of the population is called the **margin of error**. The smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population.
