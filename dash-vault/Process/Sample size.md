Your sample size should be at least 30. It has been statistically proven that 30 is the smallest sample size where the average of the sample starts to represent that of the population. This is due to a concept called [[Central limit theorem|central limit theorem]].

Increasing the sample size can:
- result in a higher [[Confidence level]]
- decrease the [[Margin of error]]
- result in greater [[Statistical significance]]
### Sample sizes vary by business problem
Sample size will vary based on the type of business problem you are trying to solve. 

For example, if you live in a city with a population of 200,000 and get 180,000 people to respond to a survey, that is a large sample size. But without actually doing that, what would an acceptable, smaller sample size look like? 

Would 200 be alright if the people surveyed represented every district in the city?

**Answer**: It depends on the stakes. 

- A sample size of 200 might be large enough if your business problem is to find out how residents felt about the new library
- A sample size of 200 might not be large enough if your business problem is to determine how residents would vote to fund the library

You could probably accept a larger margin of error surveying how residents feel about the new library versus surveying residents about how they would vote to fund it. For that reason, you would most likely use a larger sample size for the voter survey.
