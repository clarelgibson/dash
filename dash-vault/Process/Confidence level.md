The **confidence level** is used to state how confident you are in the survey results. For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your [[Margin of error|margin of error]] is at the end of your study. 95% is the most commonly used confidence interval, but 90% can work in some cases.
