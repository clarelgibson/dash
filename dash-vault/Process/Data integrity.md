Skills: #data-integrity 

The accuracy, completeness, consistency and trustworthiness of data throughout its lifecycle.

If data integrity is compromised then the conclusions of your data analysis may be inaccurate. Data integrity can be compromised in many ways:
- **Replication**: storing data in multiple locations can make it out of sync. Different people may end up producing findings from different versions of the same dataset, leading to inconsistencies.
- **Transfer**: copying data from a storage device to memory or from one computer to another. If the transfer process is interrupted you may end up with an incomplete dataset.
- **Manipulation**: changing data to make it more organized or easier to read. It is meant to make data analysis more efficient but an error during the process can compromise that efficiency.
- **Other**: human error, viruses, malware, hacking, system failures
