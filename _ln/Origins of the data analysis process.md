* Nobody knows exactly when people starting collecting data about people and things.
* Statistics has its roots in Ancient Egypt and pyramid building. Ancient Egyptians kept spreadsheets on papyrus.
* In the modern world there are many different frameworks for data analysis. They mostly follow a cyclical structure, which indicates that data analysis is an iterative process.
* A good data analysis process helps industry professionals move from data to decision.

## Some examples of data analysis processes

### Google Data Analytics Certificate
[[Google's Data Analysis Framework]]
### Dell EMC
Dell's process is cyclical, with each step leading to the next and eventually repeating.
1. Discovery
2. Pre-processing data
3. Model planning
4. Model building
5. Communicate results
6. Operationalize

### SAS
SAS uses an iterative data analysis process which they visualise as an infinity symbol.
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Explore
4. Model
5. Implement
6. Act
7. Evaluate
### Project based data analytics process
A project based approach has five steps:
* Identifying the problem
* Designing data requirements
* Pre-processing the data
* Performing the data analysis
* Visualizing the data

### Big data analytics process
Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics process in their book, **Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques**. Their process suggests phases divided into nine steps:
1. Business case evaluation
2. Data identification
3. Data acquisition and filtering
4. Data extraction
5. Data validation and cleaning
6. Data aggregation and representation
7. Data analysis
8. Data visualization
9. Utilization of analysis results
