* A real-life example of how one team used the [[Google's Data Analysis Framework|Google data analytics framework]] to improve their workplace and its business processes.
* This is an example of **people analytics** - the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company's workforce in order to gain insights on how to improve the way the company operates.
* People analytics can unlock employee potential, motivate people to perform at their best and ensure a fair and inclusive company culture.
## The situation
An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: **How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?**
### Ask
Collaborate with the key stakeholders who will be interested in the outcome of the analysis to ask effective questions such as:
* What do you think new employees need to learn to be successful in their first year on the job?
* Have you gathered data from new employees before? If so, may we access the historical data?
* Do you believe managers with higher retention rates offer new employees something extra or unique?
* What do you suspect is a leading cause of dissatisfaction among new employees?
* By what percentage would you like to see retention improve in the next fiscal year?
### Prepare
The team built a timeline of three months and decided on ways of working to relay progress to interested parties. They also used this step to identify the data sources that would be needed to identify a successful result. In this case they chose to gather data from a survey of new employees.
* They developed specific questions to ask about employee satisfaction with different processes, such as hiring and onboarding, and overall compensation.
* They established rules for who would have access to the data. For example, they decided that only those people within the analysis group would have access to the raw data, and anyone outside the group could access aggregated data.
* They decided on what specific information would be gathered and how best to present the data visually. This included identifying possible project-related issues and how to avoid them.
### Process
The group sent out the survey and made sure to adhere to data ethics practices. They ensured that employees provided their consent to participate in the survey and the ensured that participants were informed about how their data would be collected, stored, managed and protected.
* They restricted access to the raw data to a limited number of analysts.
* They cleaned the data to ensure it was complete and accurate.
* They uploaded raw data to an internal data warehouse for another layer of security.
### Analyse
When they analysed the data, the team found that employee experience with certain business processes was an indicator of overall job satisfaction.
* Employees who experienced a long and complicated hiring process were more likely to leave.
* Employees who experienced an efficient and transparent evaluation process were more likely to remain.
The analysts knew to document everything that they found in their analysis to maintain trust in the survey process.
### Share
* They shared results with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports who participated in the survey.
* They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture.
* They asked the managers to personally deliver the results to their teams.
This method of sharing the results gave managers the opportunity to personally deliver the results in the right context and have productive team conversations about improving employee engagement.
### Act
The last stage was for the analysts to provide recommendations on how best to implement change based on the findings.
* Hiring and onboarding should be standardised in accordance with best practices.
* The survey should be repeated annually and the results compared with those from the previous year.
