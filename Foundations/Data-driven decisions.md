Using facts to guide business strategy. This approach is limited by the quantity and quality of available data. If the data is insufficient or biased, it can cause problems such as over-reliance on historical data, a tendency to ignore qualitative insights and potential biases in the data analysis.
### Examples
A/B testing is a simple example of collecting data for data-driven decision-making. For example, a website that sells widgets has an idea for a new website layout they think will result in more people buying widgets. For two weeks, half of their website visitors are directed to the old site; the other half are directed to the new site. After those two weeks, the analyst gathers the data about their website visitors and the number of widgets sold for analysis. This helps the analyst understand which website layout resulted in more widget sales. If the new website performed better in producing widget sales, then the company can confidently make the decision to use the new layout!
