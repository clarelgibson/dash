Communicating and interpreting results. In this phase you present the findings of your [[Analyze|analysis]] to decision-makers in the form of a report, presentation or data visualization.
## Example
An organization was experiencing a high turnover rate among new hires. Many employees left the company before the end of their first year on the job. The analysts used the data analysis process to answer the following question: **How can the organization improve the retention rate for new employees?**

* They shared results with managers who met or exceeded the minimum number of direct reports who participated in the survey.
* They presented the results to the managers to make sure they had the full picture.
* They asked the managers to personally deliver the results to their teams.

This method of sharing the results gave managers the opportunity to personally deliver the results in the right context and have productive team conversations about improving employee engagement.
