When collecting data about a population, it is important to be aware of the actual composition of that population (in terms of demographics). Oversampling can help to represent groups in the population that otherwise wouldn't be represented fairly. Oversampling is the process of increasing the sample size of nondominant groups in a population to better represent them.
### Example
A fitness company is releasing new digital content for users of their equipment. They are interested in designing content that appeals to different users, knowing that different people may interact with their equipment in different ways. For example, part of their user-base is age 70 or older. In order to represent these users, they oversample them in their data. That way, decisions they make about their fitness content will be more inclusive.
