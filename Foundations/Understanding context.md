The analytical skill that has to do with how you group things into categories. Context refers to the conditions and circumstances that give meaning to the data. Data has little value if it is not paired with context.

Context can be as simple as the column headings in a table of data.

To contextualise your data, you need to identify:
1. **Who** created, collected or funded the data collection?
2. **What** things could this data have an impact on?
3. **Where** did the data originate?
4. **When** was the data collected or created?
5. **Why** was the data collected or created? What were the motivations?
6. **How** was the data collected or created?
