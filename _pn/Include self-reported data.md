Self-reported data is a data collection technique where participants provide information about themselves. It is a great way to introduce fairness into your data collection process. Data analysts can bring conscious and unconscious bias to their observations about the world. Self-reporting methods can help to avoid observer bias, and provide important context to your conclusions.
### Example
A data analyst is working on a project for a brick-and-mortar retailer. Their goal is to learn more about their customer base. This data analyst knows they need to consider fairness when they collect data; they decide to create a survey so that customers can self-report information about themselves. By doing that, they avoid bias that might be introduced with other demographic data collection methods. For example, if they had sales associates report their observations about customers, they might introduce any unconscious bias the employees had to the data.
