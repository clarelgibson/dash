Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics process in their book, [Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Big-Data-Fundamentals-Techniques-Technology/dp/0134291077). Their process suggests phases divided into nine steps:

1. Business case evaluation
2. Data identification
3. Data acquisition and filtering
4. Data extraction
5. Data validation and cleaning
6. Data aggregation and representation
7. Data analysis
8. Data visualization
9. Utilization of analysis results
