Fairness should be factored in at the earliest stages of a project. This means that data [[Prepare|collection]], [[Process|processing]] and [[Analyze|analysis]] are all performed with fairness in mind.
### Example
A data team kicks off a project by including fairness measures in their data-collection process. These measures include [[Use oversampling effectively|oversampling]] their population and using [[Include self-reported data|self-reported data]]. However, they fail to inform stakeholders about these measures during the [[Share|presentation]]. As a result, stakeholders leave with skewed understandings of the data. Learning from this experience, they add key information about fairness considerations to future stakeholder presentations.
