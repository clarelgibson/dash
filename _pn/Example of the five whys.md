### Boost customer service

An online grocery store was receiving numerous customer service complaints about poor deliveries. To address this problem, a data analyst at the company asked their first “why?”

**Why #1.** “Customers are complaining about poor grocery deliveries. Why?”

The data analyst began by reviewing the customer feedback more closely. They noted the vast majority of complaints dealt with products arriving damaged. So, they asked “why?” again.

**Why #2.** “Products are arriving damaged. Why?”

To answer this question, the data analyst continued exploring the customer feedback. It turned out that many customers said products were not packaged properly.

**Why #3.** “Products are not packaged properly. Why?”

After asking their third “why,” the data analyst did some further detective work. They ultimately learned that their company’s grocery packers were not adequately trained on packing procedures.

**Why #4. “**Grocery packers are not adequately trained. Why?”

This “why” enabled the data analyst to uncover that nearly 35% of all packers were new to the company. They had not yet had the chance to complete all required training, yet they were already being asked to pack groceries for customer orders.

**Why #5. “**Packers have not completed required training. Why?”

This final “why?” led the data analyst to find out that the human resources department had not provided necessary training to any newly hired packers. This was because HR was in the middle of reworking the training program. Rather than training new hires using the old system, they had provided them with a quick one-page guide, which was insufficient. 

So, in this example, the [[Root cause|root cause]] of the problem was that HR had not completed the training program updates and was using a less-thorough guide to train new packers. Fortunately, this was a problem that the grocer could control. And thanks to the data analyst’s work, they provided more support to the HR department to complete the training and retrain all newly hired grocery packers!
